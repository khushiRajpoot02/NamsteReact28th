SignIn and SignUp form
1. If the entry is large then we should add FORMIK for creating form in React
2. As I build signIn and signUp toggle, I can build same feature with cart or any other things
3. useRef Hook=> It will create the refrence of the value which we type in input box
   const email = useRef(null);
   const password = useRef(null);
   Now  email and password contains the refrence of the feild where we type our value 

How will we get the data which we type in input box in form
   One way would be
     a. to use state variables and bind that variable to the input box
     b. Whenever the input box will change, our state variable will get updated
   Another way would be (we can use refrence)
     a. Use useRef Hook   

How to host our application to firebase
    # npm install firebase
    # npm install -g firebase-tools
    # firebase login
    # firebse initia
after above commands will get 3 to 4 options, while selecting the option we have to be careful
when it ask about public directory, In create-react-app we use  ("build")
and if we use parsel we use ("dist") as a public directory
    # npm run build
    # firebase deploy
----------------------Creating userSlice--------------
key points:
  1. In redux we only can create one store, while multiple slice can be created
  2. Creted Redux store with userSlice and used it inside appStore
  3. Navigation can only happen inside child component
  4. If suppose I have done routing inside the body component and also want to do navigation from this component itself, int this case it will not work
As usersignin or signout I want to update userslice with that info
  will do it using firebase utility Auth
  and writing this function again and again will write it in utility file and from there will use it

  /*
in case of multiple child below would be the render life cycle of parent child
Parent---
--------Render phase of parent and child
   parent constructor
   parent render
     First(class)child constructor
      First(class) child render
          Second(class)child constructor
        Second(class) child render

--------DOM update of parent and child---
     First(class)child component Did Mount
    Second(class)child component Did Mount
    Parent component Did Mount
